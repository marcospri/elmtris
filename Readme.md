# Elmtris

Basic implementation of tetris in elm. 

Try it at https://marcospri.github.io/elmtris/

There's more to tetris than I knew before doing this but I just implemented the simpler options available.

I think i'm getting the gist of funciontal programming now, not sure how idomatic elm the code is but i'll work on that.
